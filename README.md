## Getting Started

FrontEndParty is just a very simple sinatra application, which means you need Ruby / Bundler to install it.  So do that first, or message me and I can help you out.

After you have that all installed, just run `bundle intall` and then just run `bundle exec rackup` and visit `localhost:9292` in your browser.
